Parser.pre_parse: function(yy)\n *                 optional: you can specify a pre_parse() function in the chunk following\n *                 the grammar, i.e. after the last `%%`.\n *  Parser.post_parse: function(yy, retval, parseInfo) { return retval; }\n *                 optional: you can specify a post_parse() function in the chunk following\n *                 the grammar, i.e. after the last `%%`. When it does not return any value,\n *                 the parser will return the original `retval`.\n *\n * ### options which can be set up per parser instance\n *\n *  yy: {\n *      pre_parse:  function(yy)\n *                 optional: is invoked before the parse cycle starts (and before the first\n *                 invocation of `lex()`) but immediately after the invocation of\n *                 `parser.pre_parse()`).\n *      post_parse: function(yy, retval, parseInfo) { return retval; }\n *                 optional: is invoked when the parse terminates due to success ('accept')\n *                 or failure (even when exceptions are thrown).\n *                 `retval` contains the return value to be produced by `Parser.parse()`;\n *                 this function can override the return value by returning another.\n *                 When it does not return any value, the parser will return the original\n *                 `retval`.\n *                 This function is invoked immediately before `parser.post_parse()`.\n *\n *      parseError: function(str, hash, ExceptionClass)\n *                 optional: overrides the default `parseError` function.\n *      quoteName: function(name),\n *                 optional: overrides the default `quoteName` function.\n *  }\n *\n *  parser.lexer.options: {\n *      pre_lex:  function()\n *                 optional: is invoked before the lexer is invoked to produce another token.\n *                 `this` refers to the Lexer object.\n *      post_lex: function(token) { return token; }\n *                 optional: is invoked when the lexer has produced a token `token`;\n *                 this function can override the returned token value by returning another.\n *                 When it does not return any (truthy) value, the lexer will return\n *                 the original `token`.\n *                 `this` refers to the Lexer object.\n *\n *      ranges: boolean\n *                 optional: `true` ==> token location info will include a .range[] member.\n *      flex: boolean\n *                 optional: `true` ==> flex-like lexing behaviour where the rules are tested\n *                 exhaustively to find the longest match.\n *      backtrack_lexer: boolean\n *                 optional: `true` ==> lexer regexes are tested in order and for invoked;\n *                 the lexer terminates the scan when a token is returned by the action code.\n *      xregexp: boolean\n *                 optional: `true` ==> lexer rule regexes are \"extended regex format\" requiring the\n *                 `XRegExp` library. When this `%option` has not been specified at compile time, all lexer\n *                 rule regexes have been written as standard JavaScript RegExp expressions.\n *  }\n */\n\n        \n    \n            var parser = (function () {\n\n\n// See also:\n// http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1382107/whats-a-good-way-to-extend-error-in-javascript/#35881508\n// but we keep the prototype.constructor and prototype.name assignment lines too for compatibility\n// with userland code which might access the derived class in a 'classic' way.\nfunction JisonParserError(msg, hash) {\n    Object.defineProperty(this, 'name', {\n        enumerable: false,\n        writable: false,\n        value: 'JisonParserError'\n    });\n\n    if (msg == null) msg = '???';\n\n    Object.defineProperty(this, 'message', {\n        enumerable: false,\n        writable: true,\n        value: msg\n    });\n\n    this.hash = hash;\n\n    var stacktrace;\n    if (hash && hash.exception instanceof Error) {\n        var ex2 = hash.exception;\n        this.message = ex2.message || msg;\n        stacktrace = ex2.stack;\n    }\n    if (!stacktrace) {\n        if (Error.hasOwnProperty('captureStackTrace')) {        // V8/Chrome engine\n            Error.captureStackTrace(this, this.constructor);\n        } else {\n            stacktrace = (new Error(msg)).stack;\n        }\n    }\n    if (stacktrace) {\n        Object.defineProperty(this, 'stack', {\n            enumerable: false,\n            writable: false,\n            value: stacktrace\n        });\n    }\n}\n\nif (typeof Object.setPrototypeOf === 'function') {\n    Object.setPrototypeOf(JisonParserError.prototype, Error.prototype);\n} else {\n    JisonParserError.prototype = Object.create(Error.prototype);\n}\nJisonParserError.prototype.constructor = JisonParserError;\nJisonParserError.prototype.name = 'JisonParserError';\n\n\n\n\n        // helper: reconstruct the productions[] table\n        function bp(s) {\n            var rv = [];\n            var p = s.pop;\n            var r = s.rule;\n            for (var i = 0, l = p.length;
